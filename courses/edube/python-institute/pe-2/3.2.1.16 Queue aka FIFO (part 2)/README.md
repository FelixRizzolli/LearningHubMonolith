# Objectives

- improving the student's skills in defining subclasses;

# Scenario

Your task is to slightly extend the `Queue` class' capabilities. We want it to have a parameterless method that returns `True` if the queue is empty and `False` otherwise.

Complete the code we've provided in the editor. Run it to check whether it outputs a similar result to ours.

# Expected output

```

dog
False
Queue empty
```
